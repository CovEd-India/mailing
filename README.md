## CovEd AutoMailing

This repository contains the code for auto informing and mailing mentors and mentees of their matchings.

### Usage

After installing the google OAuth python library run both the main files. You will have to login into the main google account via the browswer. This will generate pickle files that will store this logged in state. It is imperative that this pickle file is not shared as doing so would cause breach of security. Appropriate gitignores will be used.
